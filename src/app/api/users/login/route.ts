        // generate the access and the refresh token and encrypting them and storing them inside the browser cookies 
        // create token data

        // NOTE: HOW TO JWT TOKEN WORKS 

        // the jwt token comprises of three parts the header (containing the algorithm to be used and the type of the token which is the jwt) , the payload (it is a JSON object containing the actual core data referred to as claims (standard and custom claims)), the signature ( it is the thing that the server compares to check if the token is valid or not)

        // WORKING -
        // the header and the payload and encoded using the algorithm , To generate the final part of the JWT (the Signature), the server takes the encoded header, adds a dot, adds the encoded payload, and passes that entire combination along with your Secret Key through the hashing algorithm specified in the header.
        // When everything is assembled, the resulting string looks like this: hhhhhh.pppppp.ssssss.

        // HOW THE SERVER DECODES THE TOKEN -
        // The Server Decodes: The server splits the incoming token by the dots. It reads the header and payload to see who the user is.
        // The Server Re-Calculates: Using its private Secret Key, the server independently runs the exact same formula again: hashing the received header and payload together.
        // The Server Compares: It compares its newly calculated signature against the signature string sent by the client.
        // If they match: The server knows the token is authentic and unchanged.
        // If they do not match: If a user changes their role from "user" to "admin" in the payload, the server's calculated signature will completely mismatch the token's signature. The server will immediately catch the tampering and throw a 403 Forbidden error

        const tokenData = {
            id: user._id,
            username: user.username,
            email: user.email
        }
